   <p>In a forgotten town buried deep in the Appalachian mountains, there was a library older than the rest of the buildings that surrounded it. It was called the Pinehill Athenaeum, and by some accounts, it had been standing for at least two centuries. For reasons unknown, no one ever questioned why its wooden structure never seemed to rot, nor why the shelves always seemed to be filled with dusty, thick books that no one ever remembered donating.</p>

   <p>It was Halloween night, and for the first time in decades, the library's front light flickered on. Ellie, a local journalist, spotted the faint glow as she was driving home. She was new to the area and had heard odd whispers about Pinehill but always dismissed them as local ghost stories. Still, she was drawn to the sight. Pulling her car over, she stepped out into the foggy street, staring up at the front of the Athenaeum.</p>
    
  <p>Her feet moved before she could even think to turn back, and soon enough, she was standing in the lobby. The air inside felt still, almost too still, and the shadows seemed to dance along the walls even though there was no obvious light source other than a single lamp on the librarian's desk.</p>
    
   <p>"Hello?" she called, her voice echoing back.</p>

 <p> No answer.  Just the faint rustling of pages, as though someone were quickly turning through a book somewhere deep within the shelves.</p>
    
    Determined, she wandered deeper inside, walking past rows of strange old books with handwritten titles.</p>
    
    <p> One, in particular, caught her eye: Ellie Hargrove. She froze. How did it know her name? The book looked ancient, its leather-bound cover faded and worn. She reached out, fingers trembling, and opened it to a random page.</p>
    
    <p>  There, she found herself staring at words she recognized. They were her own thoughts—written exactly as she had thought them just hours earlier. Her gaze scanned the paragraphs, and as she read further, her breath caught. The book described her standing in the library at that very moment, turning pages, feeling her heart race, even her hand trembling. The last line read:</p>
    
    <p>   She closed the book, feeling the silence grow around her, and as she looked up, she saw them—a row of ghostly faces staring back from the shelves, each with eyes as empty as the words in their books.</p>
    
    <p> Ellie’s heart pounded, and she lifted her gaze. There, lining the shelves, were people—dozens of faces, peering out from the spines of books, mouths open as though gasping for air. She stumbled backward, dropping the book, but as it hit the floor, the faces flickered, momentarily replaced by book spines once again.</p>
    
    <p>Ellie turned to run, but the door she came through was now gone, and in its place, more shelves stretched into the darkness.</p>
    

<p>The next morning, the Athenaeum stood quiet, its front light flickering back off just as the dawn broke over the mountains. When people in the town searched for Ellie, they found nothing—nothing except a newly placed, dusty book on one of the shelves.</p>
    
    <p>It was titled The Last Visit of Ellie Hargrove, and it was still warm to the touch.</p>
